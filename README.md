Created functions in C++ to create pointers and arrays to demonstrate basic understanding of the data structure

Initializes an array with a size that the user enters
Then loops and has user fill in x numbers
used 2 ways to access and print the elements 
delete function because mem deallocate before program ends
Set array to NULL is good practice
Return zero

Dynamic Arrays allow me to allocate and deallocate memory during runtime. To insert and delete arrays
