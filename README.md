Created functions in C++ to create pointers and arrays to demonstrate basic understanding of the data structure

Process 

       1. The program initialzes an array with a interger size that the user enters.
       
       2. The program calls a for loop that create an array with x many elements. X being the number the user entered.
       
       3. Once the first for loop is finished executing, a second is called. In this for loop, elements are printed in two different ways. 
       
       4. Once the for loop is finished, the program calls the delete function. This is necessary because in C++ memory must be dealloacted       
          before the program ends
       
       5. Program sets the array to NULL. This is good practice to prevent memory leak.

By using dynamic arrays, I was able to allocate and deallocate memory during runtime. 

To use this program, it must be run in a terminal with a C++ compiler.
